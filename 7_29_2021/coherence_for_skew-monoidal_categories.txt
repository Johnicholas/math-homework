I enjoyed "Coherence for Skew-Monoidal Categories"
by Tarmo Uustalu. It seems basic / introductory / mundane in some ways,
in the same way that the Sabry and Carette paper does,
but maybe even more basic / introductory / mundane.

Both this paper, and the Sabry and Carette, said that they're basically
deformalizations of some Agda code.

Andrej Bauer described the difference between his prover (Andromeda 2)
and Agda as "Coq, Agda, Lean, … – fixed type theory"
Presumably Andromeda 2 allows the user to customize the type theory.
