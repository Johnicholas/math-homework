First we state the data to which our axioms will apply:
* Some things called sets;
* for each set X and set Y, some things called functions from X to Y, with functions f from X to Y written as f : X −→ Y 
* for each set X, set Y and set Z, an operation assigning to each f : X −→ Y and g : Y −→ Z a function f; g : X −→ Z (f;g pronounced f followed by g)
* for each set X, a function 1X : X −→ X.

This last item can be included in the list or not, according to taste. See the comments after the first axiom, which now follows.

1. Associativity of function composition

For all sets W, X, Y, Z and functions f:W->X, g:X->Y, h:Y->Z,
\[
    (f; g); h = f; (g; h)
]\

For all sets X, Y and functions f : X −→ Y, we have
\[
    1X; f = f = f; 1Y
\]

Definition of Terminal: A set T is terminal if for every set X, there is a unique function X −→ T.

2. (Existence of the singleton set) There exists a terminal set.



3. (Existence of the empty set)
Definition of elem: Given a set X, we write x ∈ X to mean x: 1 −→ X, and call x an element of X.
Definition of application: Given x ∈ X and a function f : X −→ Y , we write f x for the element x; f: 1 −→ Y of Y .
3. (Existence of the empty set) There exists a set with no elements.



4. (Functions are extensional) Let X and Y be sets and f, g : X −→ Y functions. Suppose that f(x) = g(x) for all x ∈ X. Then f = g.



5. (Products of sets)

Let X and Y be sets.
Definition of Product: A product of X and Y is a set P together with functions X, p1:P->X, p2:P->Y with the following property:
for all sets I and functions f1:I->X, f2:I->Y
there is a unique function (f1, f2): I −→ P
such that (f1, f2); p1 = f1 and (f1, f2); p2 = f2.
5. Every pair of sets has a product.


6. (Definition of function sets)
Let X and Y be sets. A function set from X to Y is a set F together with a function
ε: F × X -> Y, with the following property:
for all sets I and functions q : I × X −→ Y ,
there is a unique function q¯: I −→ F
such that q (t, x) = ε (¯q t, x) for all t ∈ I, x ∈ X.
6. (Definition of function sets) For all sets X and Y, there exists a function set from X to Y .

7. (Definition of inverse image)
Let f : X −→ Y be a function and y ∈ Y .
An inverse image of y under f is a set A together with a function j : A −→ X,
such that
f(j(a)) = y for all a ∈ A and the following property holds:
for all sets I and functions q : I −→ X such that
f(q(t)) = y for all t ∈ I, there is a unique function q¯: I −→ A such that q = q¯; j.
7. (Definition of inverse image) For every function f : X −→ Y and element y ∈ Y , there exists an inverse image of y under f.



8. (The two-element set exists)

(Definition of injection): An injection is a function j : A −→ X such that
for a, a0 ∈ A . j a = j a0 implies a = a0

(Definition of subset classifier) A subset classifier is a set 2 together with an element t ∈ 2, with the following property:
for all sets A, X and injections j : A −→ X, there is a unique function χ: X −→ 2 such that j : A −→ X is an inverse image of t under χ.

8. (The two-element set exists) There exists a subset classifier.

9. (The natural numbers exist)
A natural number system is a set N together with an element 0 ∈ N and a function s: N −→ N, with the following property:
whenever X is a set, a ∈ X, and r : X −→ X, there is a unique function x: N −→ X such that x(0) = a and x(s(n)) = r(x(n)) for all n ∈ N.

10. (Choice)

(Definition of surjection) A surjection is a function s: X −→ Y such that
for all y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X with s(x) = y.

(Definition of right inverse) A right inverse of a function s: X −→ Y is a function i: Y −→ X such that
i; s = 1Y .

10. (Choice) Every surjection has a right inverse.
