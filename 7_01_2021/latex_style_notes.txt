EXAMPLE 1:

\begin{definition}
\label{homIntoXDef}
Given a category $C$, $X$ an object, define $Hom(-, X)$ to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item take an object $Y$ to $hom(Y, X)$ of arrows in $C$ from $Y$ to $X$, and
  \marginpar{\emph{TODO}: $hom$ notation here is used without being introduced previously}
  \item take an arrow $f: Z \rightarrow Y$ to the ``pullback'' function $f^* = \lambda x . f ; x$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

BECOMES

Consider the rule
\[
  \mathrm{Pow} \colon \mathrm{Set} \to \mathrm{Set}
\]
which associates a set \(S\) to its power set
\[
  \mathrm{Pow}(S) := \{ X \mid X \subset S \}
\]
and which associates a function \(f \colon S \to T\)
the inverse image
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{Pow}(f) \colon \mathrm{Pow}(T) &\to \mathrm{Pow}(S) \\
  Y & \mapsto f^{-1}(Y).
\end{align*}
We check this is a contravariant functor...

EXAMPLE 2

\begin{definition}
\label{powdefn}
Define $Pow$ to take a set to its power set,
and also take functions $f : Z \rightarrow Y$
to a function that takes subsets of $Y$ to their preimage according to $f$,
which is a subset of $Z$.
\end{definition}

Given a category \(C\), an object \(X\) inside \(C\),
we have the functor
\[
  \operatorname{Hom}_C(-,X) \colon
  C^{\mathrm{opp}} \to \mathrm{Set}
\]
such that
\begin{itemize}
\item given another object \(Y\) inside \(C\), \(\operatorname{Hom}(Y,X)\) is the
set of arrows in \(C\) from \(Y\) to \(X\), and
\item given an arrow \(f \colon Z \to Y\) in \(C\),
we have
\begin{align*}
f^* \colon \operatorname{Hom}_C(Y,X) & \to 
\operatorname{Hom}_C(Z,X) \\
(g \colon Y \to X) & \mapsto (g \circ f \colon Z \to Y \to X).
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}

INFERRED RULES:

1. avoid $ to get into math mode, use \(. These are balanced, unlike $, which leads to better error messages and better error correction.

2. use \[ routinely in order to get space around something

3. Hom is typed \operatorname{Hom} QUESTION: What does \operatorname do?

4. opp is typed \mathrm{opp} and Set is typed \

5. Use \colon for the punctuation between a map's name and its type.
6. Use \to for the right arrow, not \rightarrow
