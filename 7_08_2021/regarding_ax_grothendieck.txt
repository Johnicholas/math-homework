This is a theorem that, in certain circumstances, something that is known to be an injection, is actually a bijection.

Discussed here:

which is elaborated on here:

and references this:

also references this, which gives a rough dictionary for analogies between `hard' and `soft' analysis:

There are two simpler situations:
1. If a function from a finite set to itself is injective, then it is bijective.
2. If a polynomial function from the reals to themselves is injective, then it is bijective.

The way the Ax-Grothendieck proof proceeds, as far as I understand it (which is not very far), is something like this: a polynomial over finite fields that is an injection is a bijection (because of the simpler situation 1),
However, if, in the infinitary situations that Ax-Grothendieck applies to, there was a counter example, then there would be a corresponding, finitary, "shadow" counterexample, which would be a contradiction.
