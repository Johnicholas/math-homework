Maybe something like 
"Introduction to Axiomatic Geometry" https://ohioopen.library.ohio.edu/opentextbooks/1/
or
"Axiomatic Geometry" https://bookstore.ams.org/amstext-21
or maybe just the list of theorems that it claims to prove:
https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/Books/AG/theorems.pdf

Maybe https://store.doverpublications.com/0486847268.html
which claims to describe a "coordinate method"
suitable for proving (in Maple?) theorems like:
14.31 Suppose that three circles with equal radii intersect at a point. For each pair of these circles, consider the other point of their intersection. Prove that these three points lie on a circle of the same radius.

14.32 (Ptolemy's Theorem) Consider four points A, B, C, and D in the plane. Prove they lie on a circle if and only if A B * C D + B C * A D= A C * B D.

14.33 Given three circles of radii r_1, r_2 and r_3, such that each is externally tangent to the other two, find the radius of a circle that passes through the points of tangency of these three circles.

Maybe looking for somehow adjacent things to existing, somewhat elementary things would be good.
Something like the Corset Theorem

or the Shoelace Formula
