The factorial formula

There is a factorial formula https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient#Multiplicative_formula
choose N K = N! / K! (N - K)!
shich makes me think that something like quotienting a set of size N! such as the elements of S_N, the symmetric group on N elements,
or the elements of the set of total orders of N elements,
by some equivalence relation? relating to permutations of K things (the items being selected?) and permutations of (N-K) things
(the spaces being left behind?).

If you have 3 things a, b, c,
there are six total orders {abc, acb, cab, cba, bca, bac}.
If I quotient by permutations of {a, b}, then I get {**c, *c*, c**}.

If you have 4 things a, b, c, d
then there are 24 total orders
If I quotient by permutations of {a, b} and also quotient by permutations of {c, d},
then I get a set (of equivalence classes), something like this:
{**--, *-*-, *--*, -*-*, --**, -**-}
which has the right cardinality.
I imagine to `read this out', you ask whether the bottom or top element is of * kind or - kind?
