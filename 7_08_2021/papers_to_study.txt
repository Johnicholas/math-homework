"âˆž-Category Theory for Undergraduates" is a nearly comprehensible talk by Emily Riehl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6hXn6QCu0k
which points to this nearly incomprehensible paper by Riehl and Shulman:
"A type theory for synthetic infinity categories"

"Puzzles, tableaux, and mosaics" by Kevin Purbhoo has some of this sort of hexagonal diagrams,
the relationship to a categorification of the trinomials is probably superficial.

Maybe this "How to reach research level math" map is valuable.
