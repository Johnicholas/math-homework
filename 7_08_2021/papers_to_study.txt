I think there is something that must be analogous, in 3d,
to two-dimensional lattice paths,
something more like a surface spanning six corners of a cuboid?

Is this just a tiling of a hexagon by diamonds?

I think you might be able to factor one of these things into a lattice path along one of the sides,
and a smaller thing which is also a tiling-of-hexagon-by-diamonds,
in six ways, corresponding to cutting a layer off of each of the six sides of the cuboid,
analogously to the way you can factor a lattice path into a boolean and a smaller lattice path in two ways (off the front and back of the path).

"Puzzles, tableaux, and mosaics" by Kevin Purbhoo has some of this sort of hexagonal diagrams,
the relationship to a categorification of the trinomials is probably superficial.
