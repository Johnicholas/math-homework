In order to say something about (a+b)^n, that is n \to a+b, a map into a coproduct,
we need to construct a triple that we can apply the
coproduct unversal property to; I don't think there's guaranteed to be much of anything in a generic category with a coproduct of a and b, even a category with all binary coproducts.

* What if there was a terminal object in the category?
* Alternately, what if there was a subobject classifier, 2?
* Alternately, what if there was a Natural Numbers object in the category?

Would I get all of these if I had a category with all finite coproducts, including 0?
