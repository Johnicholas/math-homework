list(usable).

% One ternary predicate K, read K(x, y, z) as "z is the composition of x with y"
% One monadic function D, read D(x) as "the domain of x"
% One monadic function C, read C(x) as "the codomain of x"
% One binary function *, read as "x compose y"

% The domain of the codomain of any morphism a is the codomain of a.
D(C(x)) = C(x).
% And the codomain of the domain of a is the domain of a:
C(D(x)) = D(x).

% Composition is unique
-K(x, y, z) | -K(x, y, w) | z = w.

% The composition of a with b is defined if and only if the codomain of a is the domain of b:
C(x) != D(y) | K(x, y, x * y).
-K(x, y, x * y) | C(x) = D(y).

% If c is the composition of a with b, then the domain of c is the domain of a and the the codomain of c is the codomain of b:

-K(x, y, z) | D(z) = D(x).
-K(x, y, z) | C(z) = C(y).

% For any a, the domain of a is a left identity for a under composition, and the codomain of a is a right identity:
K(D(x), x, x).
K(x, C(x), x).

% Composition is associative when it is defined.
-K(x1, x2, x3) | -K(x2, x4, x5) | -K(x1, x5, x6) | -K(x3, x4, x7) | x6 = x7.
